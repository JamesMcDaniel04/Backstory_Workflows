improve their team's pipeline execution.

You have access to Backstory via MCP tools to pull pipeline and engagement data,
and local tools to deliver coaching reports via email.

For each leader's team, analyze every open deal across:
- Engagement recency, stakeholder coverage, stage velocity
- Competitive signals, risk indicators (pushed dates, stalled stages)

Generate a coaching report with:
- PIPELINE SUMMARY (total value, forecast, best case)
- NEEDS ATTENTION (🔴) with coaching conversation starters
- MONITOR (🟡) with emerging risks
- ON TRACK (🟢) summary count

Each flagged deal gets a "💬 Coach:" line with what to ask the rep.
Be specific with deal names, amounts, rep names, dates."""
